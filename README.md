# Development challenge
Medcloud's challenge for Dev Full Stack

## Goal

To develop a web application to manage patient registers (Patient's name, birth date, email and address) using data persistence.

## Required

- You need to develop both the front-end and the back-end.
- In the front-end you MUST use React.
- In the back-end you MUST use NodeJS, GoLang or Python.
- The patient data should not be static or local.
- You're free to choose which persistence mechanism will be used in the challenge (Relational or non-relational database, XML, text file, etc).

## Extra Points

- Deploy in a cloud platform.
- Cache the data in-browser.
- Use Material UI https://material-ui.com.
- Make the interface easy to use (UI/UX).

## Extra Points + 1

Use AWS Free Tier on back-end (Lambda, API Gateway, DynamoDB or RDS).
